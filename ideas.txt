    - lets work on getting the notifications
        - have a box on the dashboard with all notifications (/notifications)
            - notifications will include
            1. global Updates - not sure how ill do this probably an admin dashboard for personal use to send out an update
            2. project requests - this is the first step to determine if i can accept or decline
            3. application Updates - display updates on project requests
            4. friend requests - need to build the Explore users page first
            5. maybe project updates - if anything ill put a red circle in the corner of the project cards on the dashboard for notifications within the project

6. project discovery page
    - if the user is the project owner hide the apply button completely
    - style filtering better

    - Search/filters based on interests, location, roles, and username
    - display user cards in a 3x4 grid
    - once a user clicks on a user card pull in an overlay card with more details on the usern
    - in the user overlay there will be an option to send the user a message or collab request
    - have a section where users can view project application requests
    - have a section where users can check the status on their own applications

8. individual Projects
    - idk the details yet but pretty much make it like slack and trello
